* While creating tables in RDBMS databases, we should specify data types for the columns.
  * SERIAL is nothing but integer which is populated by a special database object called as   sequence. It is typically used for surrogate primary key.
  * When SERIAL is specified, a sequence with table_name_serial_column_seq naming      convention will be created. In our case it is users_user_id_seq.

As our database table creation and data insertion script is quite big, we have used command line approach. However, we should always be able to run simple scripts using SQL Workbench itself. We should be able to perform all the permitted operations based on permissions given to user used to connect to database.

As connectivity between SQL Workbench and MySQL on docker is validated, now one should be able to quickly take care of SQL exercises.

* Check the version of anaconda - `brew cask info anaconda`
* Install anaconda3 - `brew cask install anaconda`
* Clone GitHub Repository - `git clone https://github.com/dgadiraju/itversit...`
* Get into the folder - `cd itversity-books`
* Launch Jupyter Lab and start learning using the books available as part of the repository. - `/opt/local/anaconda3/bin/jupyter lab`
* You can also launch `Anaconda Navigator` UI and launch Jupyter Lab from it. However it will open the folders from Home Directory, you just need to ensure to navigate to appropriate folder that contain books and start practicing as demonstrated.

At ITVersity, we are going to open source quite a bit of content to learn key Data Engineering Skills using Scala, Python, Spark etc and we are going to provide up to date pre-configured virtual machines.
You can build virtual machine for the practice using this Vagrant File available in this GitHub Repository - https://github.com/dgadiraju/itversity-boxes

In case if you want to install Virtualbox and Vagrant before using Vagrant box provided, feel free to watch this 1 hour video and then go ahead and start using vagrant commands to leverage the new virtual machine with Spark and content - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osPz2_pclTk

"ubP0QxxTilA","UCakdSIPsJqiOLqylgoYmwQg","03 Create HDFS User for retail using keytab",,"How to manage functional users such as retail in Kerberized Hadoop and Spark Clusters?

Earlier we have seen the most straight forward way - create principal with password and then create tickets from the servers from where you want to submit the jobs.

However there are few caveats with this approach.

* Every time you want to create a ticket you will be prompted for the password. It will make the automation tough.
* If some one hacked into other servers with the functional user (retail) and if he know the password for the principal, he can create tickets and perform operations in the cluster.

To address these 2 issues, we typically use key based approach.
* Create principal with random key
* Generate Keytab file
* Copy the Keytab file to the desired servers from which you want to authenticate users.
* Change the ownership and restrict permissions on the Keytab file.

Now the user such as retail can only perform the tasks from those nodes where there is Keytab file. This approach will solve both the above mentioned problems and enhances security in kerberized cluster.

As things are simplified using Cloudera Manager Wizard, what happens internally? Unless I understand those details, I will not be able to support.

if you are also curious, here is the answer for that. We are in the process of simplifying Kerberos concepts.

* Principals will be created and then Keytab files will be generated based up on the cluster topology.
* There will be several properties changes for each and every service in the cluster to use Kerberos for authentication and authorization.
* When ever you manage the service using Cloudera Manager, the underlying service owner will run kinit command using keytab file against principal to get the ticket.
* Keytab files generated in KDC will be copied to internal folders which are used by Cloudera.
* Typically tickets will be destroyed once the task is performed.

"SmLx4VXbHho","UCakdSIPsJqiOLqylgoYmwQg","Apache Spark - How to determine executors for a given Spark Job?",,"Following is the question from one of my Self Paced Data Engineering Bootcamp 6 Student.

https://kaizen.itversity.com/shop/all-courses/data-engineering-bootcamp/

Topic Link: http://discuss.itversity.com/t/apache-spark-how-to-determine-executors-for-a-given-spark-job/17742

How does a developer arrive at a decision to pass control arguments to override the executor memory and cores in a spark job ? Is there a decision-making hierarchy in engineering teams that the developer would have to go through?
As part of this live session/pre-recorded video, I will answer the above question. Here are the details which need to be understood.

* Cluster Capacity - YARN (or Mesos)
* Static Allocation vs. Dynamic Allocation
* Determining and use Capacity based on the requirement
* Setting Properties at Run Time
* Setting Properties Programmatically
* Overview of --num-executors, --executor-cores, --executor-memory
* Decision Making Hierarchy

Demos are given using our state of the art labs. If you are interested you can sign up at https://labs.itversity.com

"WseIB2i7LRc","UCakdSIPsJqiOLqylgoYmwQg","File Formats and Custom Delimiters - Data Frames Persistence",,"Now let us see how we can persist data frames.

To get access to complete course which contains videos, reference material, code, labs and support, - you need to purchase https://kaizen.itversity.com/shop/all-courses/data-engineering-bootcamp/

* By default, data will be streamed as data frames to executor 
   tasks as data being processed.
* Here is what will happen when data is read into executor task 
   while it is being processed
    * Deserialize into object
    * Stream into memory
    * Process data by executor task by applying logic
    * Flush deserialized objects from memory as executor tasks are 
       terminated
* Some times we might have to read same data multiple times for 
   processing with in the same job. By default every time data need 
   to be deserialized and submitted to executor tasks for 
   processing
* To avoid deserializing into java objects when same data have to 
   be read multiple times we can leverage caching.
* There are 2 methods persist and cache. By default with data 
   frames caching will be done as MEMORY_AND_DISK from Spark 
   2.
* cache is shorthand method for persist at MEMORY_AND_DISK
* This is what happens when we cache Data Frame
    * Caching will be done only when data is read at least once for 
       processing
    * Each record will be deserialized into object
    * These deserialized objects will be cached in memory as long 
       as they fit
    * If not, deserialized objects will be spilled out to disk
* You can get details about different persistence levels from here.

* We can read text data into RDD using SparkContext’s textFile. It 
   will treat newline character as a record delimiter.
* We have to parse each record in RDD and derive data to process 
   further
* With Spark Data Frames we have csv and text APIs to read text 
   data int Data Frame
* Both of them use newline character as a record delimiter. When 
   we use csv API to create data frame we can also specify field 
   separator/delimiter using sep as one of the options.
* We can also specify sep while writing data into text files with any 
   field separator or delimiter using csv API. Also, we can 
   concatenate data as part of selectExpr with a delimiter of our 
   choice and use text API.
* Here is the example to read and write data with ascii null 
   character.

* Hive is used to create databases, tables and process data in Big 
   Data Clusters.
* It uses HDFS for the file system. A Hive database or a table or a 
   partition is nothing but a directory in HDFS.
* Once we create table metadata will be stored in an RDBMS 
   database configured. We have configured our Hive with MySQL.
* Hive also have query engine. A query will be typically compiled 
   into Map Reduce Job.
* Once we have tables created, we can run queries using different 
   query engines.
    * Hive
    * Tez
    * Impala
    * Spark SQL
    * Presto
    * and more
* Hive support DDL, batch data load as well as inserting query 
   results on top of running SQL type queries.
* Let us create Hive Database, create few tables and process using 
   standard Hive Queries before we jump into Spark SQL.

       between the two using order_id (in order_items, it is 
       represented as order_item_order_id)
    * We also have product catalog normalized into 3 tables – 
       products, categories, and departments (with relationships esta 
       blished in that order)
    * We also have a customers table
    * There is relationship between customers and orders – 
       customers is parent data set as one customer can place 
       multiple orders.
    * There is a relationship between the product catalog and 
       order_items via products – products is parent data set as one 
       product can be ordered as part of multiple order_items.
* Determine the type of join – inner or outer (left or right or full)
* Data Frames have an API called join to perform joins
* We can make the join outer by passing an additional argument
* By default joins are broadcast. It is similar to look up in the 
   conventional ETL process. Copy of smaller data set will be 
   broadcasted on to all the nodes rather than joining via shuffling 
   between the stages.
* Beyond a pre-configured broadcast size, join will be done using 
   shuffling process.

* We can create variable for function and convert into UDF, using 
   org.apache.spark.sql.functions.udf. It will return object of type 
   org.apache.spark.sql.expressions.UserDefinedFunction
* Once UDF is created we can use it as part of any transformation

* However, if we want to use it as part of SQL style syntax, we need

   while applying functions.
* We can take care of it using selectExpr. Whatever functions we 
   pass to selectExpr should follow Hive syntax. If we use split, we 
   need to use [] to access elements from the array generated as 
   result for the split.
* We also have expr which works in similar fashion while using

* Many times we will get metadata about data in the form of 
   control files.
* Control files will have information such as column names, Data 
   Types etc.
* We need to create fields in Data Frame dynamically using column 
   names and Data Types provided as part of control files.
* The process is divided into two steps
     * Create Schema
     * Create Data Frame using Schema

* We get getters and setters with case classes.
* It implements Serializable and Product
* While Serializable gives us functionality to convert the object to 
   the data stream, Product will give us functionality such as

   convert data in flat files into Data Frames directly.
* There are some file formats which are available on sc, but not on 
   spark.read. In those scenarios we might have to load data from

* While the job is running it is served by Application Master using 
   Resource Manager Web Interface as Proxy.
* There are several important tabs which we should be familiar 
   with
     * Executors
     * Jobs
     * Stages
     * Environment
     * Storage
* It is very important to spend some time and understand all these 
   different components of Spark UI.

To get access to complete course which contains videos, reference material, code, labs and support, - you need to purchase https://kaizen.itversity.com/shop/all-courses/data-engineering-bootcamp/

* Local Mode
* Stand Alone Mode (Spark Native)
* Mesos Mode
* YARN Mode

Local and Stand Alone is used for development and exploratory purposes. In Production we either use Mesos or YARN.

   * Most of the Big Data distributions such as Cloudera, 
      Hortonworks etc have eco system of tools such as Kafka, 
      Hadoop etc along with Spark.
   * They are typically deployed using YARN, while Spark exclusive 
      clusters typically use Mesos.
   * As our clusters are either built using Hortonworks or Cloudera 
      Distribution, we tend to run our Spark Jobs using YARN mode.
   * We can make YARN default while setting up clusters. However, 
      if the cluster is configured to use local mode, then we can 
      overwrite it by using –master as part of spark-submit or spark - 
      shell

APIs on top of RDDs are categorized into Transformations and Actions.

* Transformations take RDD as input and return another RDD as 
   output.
    * Row-level transformations – map and flatMap
    * Filtering data – filter
    * Aggregations – reduceByKey, aggregateByKey
    * Joins – join, leftOuterJoin, rightOuterJoin
    * Sorting – sortByKey
    * Ranking can be done with groupByKey along with anonymous 
       functions
    * Set Operations – union, intersection
* When transformations are used, Spark Job will not run 
   immediately. It will update DAG.
* Actions take RDD as input and perform the specified action such 
   as converting RDD into the local collection in driver program or 
   save into file system.
* Action trigger execution of the Spark Job. If there are multiple 
   actions in the Spark application, each of that action triggers a 
   new job.
* DAG stands for Directed Acyclic Graph and the process of 
   deferring execution until action is performed is called as lazy 
   evaluation.

* SparkConf has several APIs to set and get the properties. We can 
   overwrite any property using set.
* There are some additional APIs such as appName, master etc. 
   appName is a handy function which overwrites spark.app.name 
   property while master overwrites spark.master property.
* Once the SparkConf object is created, it can be passed to the 
   constructor of SparkContext to create a context object.

         Mesos, Stand Alone or local)
      * It will start web service on port number 4040 (we can override 
         by overwriting the value for spark.ui.port)
* SparkContext object exposes several APIs which include those 
   APIs that can be used to read the data from files (e. g.: textFile, 
   sequenceFile etc)
* We have to set all the properties first using SparkConf object and

* Once we get order_item_subtotal for each item we can add those 
   to get total order revenue.
* We can validate using IDE by passing Run Time arguments
* Once this is done we can use sbt and build jar file out of it
   * Go to the project working directory
   * Run sbt package
   * You will see jar file under target/scala_2.11

* scala.io package has few simple APIs which read data from the

* To read data from File we can use this API – 
   scala.io.Source.fromFile(“PATH_TO_FILE”)
* It will create an object of type BufferedSource
* We can apply getLines on top of BufferedSource to create non- 
   empty Iterator where each element is of type String (we have 
   passed text file as path earlier)
* Once we got the iterator, we can convert into any collection type 
   based upon our requirement.

* We can launch Scala REPL using Scala
* REPL stands for Read, Evaluate, Print, and Loop. It is an 
   interactive way of building logic.
* You can perform arithmetic operations, invoke functions, or even 
   develop functions.
* Each line of code is evaluated separately by being compiled into 
  Java bytecode. Hence many times each line can be treated in an 
   isolated way. Due to that, we should be able to define variables 
   with the same name.

We have learnt about Accumulators in the last one.

Course Link: https://kaizen.itversity.com/shop/all-courses/apache-spark-2-with-python-3-pyspark/

Following are the topics covered as part of this session:

* Take the code from the previous topic where orders, order_items and products are joined
* Instead of creating RDD from products data from local file system and join products, we will broadcast it and perform lookup
* Load products data from local file system and create dict
* Look up into dict using product_id and get product_name
* Also we will understand repartition and coalesce in detail

Course Link: https://kaizen.itversity.com/shop/all-courses/apache-spark-2-with-python-3-pyspark/

We have lot of modules which provide functions for most of the logic we are building as part of this session. This session is to just lay foundation about how data can be processed and also to build intuition around collections.

We will be developing applications for below tasks:

* Build set of order statuses from list of orders
* Get revenue for a given order_id from order_items
* Build dict of order_id and revenue in the process of getting revenue for each order
* Build dict of date and revenue after filtering for COMPLETE and CLOSED orders and join with order_items to get date and revenue for those COMPLETE and CLOSED orders.

There are also exercises which you can give a try after understanding these basic concepts.

* Understanding cost
* Make sure there is Key Pair
* Launch instances with CentOS 7
* Add 2 additional hard drives of 60 GB each
* Use appropriate key pair
* Create tag so that we can easily identify instances
* Launch instances
* Make sure we can navigate through nodes using SSH Forwarding.
* Configure foxyproxy

Either we will use virtual machines created on bare metal server or EC2 instances to set up clusters using technologies like Hadoop.

To get access to complete course which contains videos, reference material, code, labs and support, - you need to purchase https://kaizen.itversity.com/shop/all-courses/data-engineering-bootcamp/ 

* Why to setup Spark?
   * Before deploying on the cluster, it is good practice to test the 
      script using spark-submit.
   * To run using spark-submit locally, it is nice to setup Spark on 
      Windows
* How to setup Spark?
   * Install 7z so that we can unzip and untar spark tar ball, from here
   * Download spark 2.3 tar ball by going here
       * Choose Spark Release: 2.3.0
       * Choose a package type: Pre-built for Hadoop 2.7 or later
       * It gives the appropriate link pointing to mirror
       * Click on it go to mirror and click on it to download
       * Use 7z software to unzip and under to complete setup of 
          spark
* We need to configure environment variables to run Spark any 
   where
* Keep in mind that Spark is not very well supported on Windows 
   and we will see how to setup on Ubuntu using Windows 
   subsystem for Linux.

* Before getting started check whether Java and JDK are installed or not
* Launch command prompt – Go to search bar on windows laptop, type cmd and hit enter
* Type java -version If it return version, check whether 1.8 or not. It is better to have 1.8 version. If you have other version, consider uninstall and install 1.8 (Search for programs installed and uninstall Java)
* Type javac -version If it return version, check whether 1.8 or not. It is better to have 1.8 version. If you have other version, consider uninstall and install 1.8 (Search for programs installed and uninstall Java)
* If you need other versions, make sure environment variables point to 1.8
* If you do not have Java at all, make sure to follow the instructions and install 1.8 version of JRE and JDK.
* Why do we need to install Java and JDK? Scala, Spark and many other technologies require Java and JDK to develop and build the applications. Scala is JVM based programming language.
* How to install Java and JDK? 
  * Go to official page of Oracle where downloads are available
  * Accept the terms and download 64 bit version
* How to validate?
  * Use java -version and javac -version commands in command prompt and see they return 1.8 or not

* Conduct dry run of webex to make sure you do not have issues once the training is started
* Training rules (always be on mute, ask questions via chat, disable video streaming using webcam etc)
* Tips for college going students
* YouTube streaming and playlist details
* Accessing the lab
* Q&A sessions

1. Use full clone on VMWare Workstation

3. Bring down eth1 ""ifconfig eth1 down""

I shared information provided in the video with them and they end up saving up to 300$ to 600$ per year. So, I thought of providing a video which explains how to choose your electricity provider using powertochoose.org

Save and enjoy your hard earned dollars by going to powertochoose.org when ever you are due for renewal.

Please like it and comment how much you save as I am planning for an automated web application if there is good response to this video. Connect with me or follow me at
