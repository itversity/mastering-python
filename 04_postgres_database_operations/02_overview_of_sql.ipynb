    "SQL stands for Structured Query Language and it is broadly categorized into following:\n",
    "* DDL - Data Definition Language\n",
    "  * Creating Database Objects such as Tables, Indexes etc.\n",
    "  * Define constraints such as not null, primary key, foreign key etc.\n",
    "* DML - Data Manipulation Language\n",
    "  * Inserting or Updating data in the tables\n",
    "  * Deleting data from the tables\n",
    "* DQL - Data Query Language\n",
    "  * Project the data\n",
    "  * Filter based up on the requirements\n",
    "  * Join multiple tables\n",
    "* TCL - Transaction Control Language\n",
    "  * Commit to persistently store the changes.\n",
    "  * Rollback to revert back changes to the prior state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically as part of applications we perform CRUD Operations which are nothing but DML and DQL."
