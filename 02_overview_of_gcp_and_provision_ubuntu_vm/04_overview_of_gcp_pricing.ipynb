    "It is very important to spend some time and understand the pricing of GCP for the virtual machine.\n",
    "* GCP Provides Pricing Calculator to estimate the cost.\n",
    "* Here is the configuration for our Virtual Machine.\n",
    "  * 8 GB RAM\n",
    "  * At least 2 core CPU\n",
    "  * 60 GB Storage\n",
    "* For Storage, we will have fixed cost as long as it is provisioned.\n",
    "* For Virtual Machine (CPU and Memory), we will be paying only for the time for which the Virtual Machine is up and running.\n",
    "* Best Practices to get most out of the credit or to reduce the cost of using GCP.\n",
    "  * Ensure that you stop the Virtual Machine when you are not using.\n",
    "  * Make sure to use static ip address (incurs a nominal fixed cost).\n",
    "  * Make sure to open only those ports that are relevant to you (to avoid attacks)."
